# wargames-server
Server-side code for the WarGames framework.

The server plays the role of the referee for war games. Clients communicate with the server using an API defined in JSON-RPC.

The framework implements the most basic rules. To extend this logic, the framework calls user-code at certain times that add logic specific to a game system.
